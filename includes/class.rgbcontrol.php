  # NOTICE:
  # I am not responsible for any damage you might cause to your power supply, Raspberry Pi, LEDs or to yourself.
  # If you plug a wrong wire into wrong pin, you might fry your RPi. I, myself, managed to do it by accident once.

  # What you will need:
  # Raspberry Pi, preferably model B(+), as it has more RAM.
  # 3 TIP120 transistors, which can be found on ebay for about 1€ for five (including shipping)
  # RGB LED (strip)
  # Hookup wire (can be bought from ebay for about 1€)
  # Jumper wire (can be bought from ebay for about 1€)

  # This class was written for one reason: easy usage of RGB LEDs with Raspberry Pi.
  # Should be easy to use, and each function has a simple help section to it.

  # This class was written to be used in conjuction with PiBlaster (https://github.com/sarfata/pi-blaster).
  # PiBlaster creates a special file in /dev/pi-blaster, and any application can write to it, meaning you don't have to be root to control the LEDs.

  # Simplest usage would be:

   /*
   <?php
    require "class.rgbcontrol.php";
    $led = new LedControl(18,23,24); #G PIO Pins on RPi
    $led->setHex("#FFF000"); # Will provide yellowish color.
  ?>
  */

  # However, I've included a all-in-one package which requires nothing else but you setting up the RPi and connecting the LEDs correctly.

  # About file_put_contents:
  # PiBlaster guides you to use 'echo "18=0.2" > /dev/pi-blaster' directly to command-line. That is the fastest way.
  # So you might think that shell_exec('echo "18=0.2" > /dev/pi-blaster'); would be faster, than file_put_contents, but it isn't.
  # I ran some rough tests with PHPs built in function, microtime, and file_put_contents was 44 times faster.

    * This function allows you to power each of these three colours.
    * Example:
    * $led->setColor("red",0.1);
    * The first parameter is for colour, and it can be red, green or blue. Case sensitive, but you can do something about that, if you want.
    * The second parameter is for amount of power you want to use. Basically 0-1, but you can use decimal values, 0.47 for example. This is how you generate different colours.
    * This function is mainly useful when developing custom "disco" lights, as it's easier to edit a value between quotes than setRed to setGreen. Try double clicking the word green. setColor("green",0.1).

    * What if you changed the order of the wires on your RPi? Then you would have to modify every instance of new LedControl(1,2,3) to get correct colors.
    * So you can use pretty much any function inside this class, if you simply use $this instead of $led when you're calling those functions.
    * Scroll down for examples.

    * About sleeping ("fading"):
    * PHP has a function "sleep()" which allows to wait for x number of seconds. But it doesn't work with 0.5 for example.
    * Use usleep() for less than second waits.
